# Data_Mining_Exploration

This project was completed in December of 2023 for a data mining class during my MS in Business Analytics.

It includes multiple machine learning models with varying levels of accuracy that, with a lot of consideration, I determined to be the best I have learned how to do with the dataset chosen. I am proud to show the successes in this project as well as some of the shortcomings, because they allowed me to figure out how these models work with a more in-depth understanding.
